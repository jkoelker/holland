"""
The purpose of this module is to test application functionality.  It is here
as an example of how one might perform nose testing on an application built
on top of the Cement Framework.  It is not a fully comprehensive test, of the
application... and needs to be expanded as the application grows.

The initial file loaded by nose runs the application.  Additional calls are
then made via the 'simulate' function rather than needing to reload the 
application for every test.
